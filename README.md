# Gait Simulation

The purpose of this repository is to generate python scripts to assist with data conversion and OpenSim automation.

Primary tasks:

- [X] merge landmark and trajectory data into a single flat file
- [ ] convert merged data into a single trc file

Secondary tasks:

- [ ] convert ground reaction force data into a format appropriate for OpenSim
- [ ] bulk export of data
- [ ] include gait events in data
- [ ] visualization of data for confirmation
- [ ] slicing of tracking and GRF data into individual files for automated processing
